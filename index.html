The cause can be scattered clouds, wind-moving leaves, or light scattering throughout the canopy.</p>
<p>I'm interested in how photosynthesis is regulated under these conditions, so harmful by-products can be avoided, and the photosynthetic machinery is sufficiently protected, yet over-protection and resulting inefficiency are avoided.</p>

<p>This allowed me to apply and improve my skills in software development, data science, and photosynthesis research to advance a novel platform aimed at sharing photosynthetic measurements in new ways. These tools can now be used in my research on the regulation of photosynthesis <em>in situ</em> at a larger scale and under various, real-world environmental conditions.</p>

These photosynthetic measurements were collected in lab and greenhouse settings and, more critically, in real-world field environments and natural habitats.</p>
<p>They include fluorescence changes measured using the Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) to determine parameters like quantum efficiency (Φₗₗ), the absorbance-based electrochromic shift (ECS), and relative chlorophyll content. The measurements can be accompanied by environmental data including contactless leaf temperature.</p>
<p>This large, open, and growing data collection will hopefully enable a better understanding of how photosynthesis is regulated in dynamic environments.</p>

While photosystem II is the first step in the electron transport chain to split water, photosystem I catalyzes the final step, transferring electrons from plastocyanin to ferredoxin.</p>
<p>My graduate work in Dr. Michael Hippler's lab focused on the interaction between photosystem I and plastocyanin in <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> and how small modifications to specific amino acids at the photosystem's donor side can alter the binding kinetics and drastically impact the rate of photosynthesis as a whole.</p>
