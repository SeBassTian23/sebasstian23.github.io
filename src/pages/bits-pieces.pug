          p Some small projects and code bits from a long time ago; polished and brought back to life. 
            | Most of them were either part of a work project or were just from tinkering around in my free time.

          p This was a small project to build an interactive Periodic Chart of Elements as part of an application, that never came to be.
          p The element information is provided by Pubchem.

          p Biologists have a Periodic Chart too! Like the one for Elements, this chart was also intended to be part of an application.
          p The chart was originally published by Bachem AG.

          p Working with plants or algae provides the option to use either total protein content or chlorophyll content for the planned experiment.
          p This calculator allows calculating the chlorophyll content according to Porra et al.

          p Formatting a DNA/RNA or AminoAcid sequence can be a pain, especially if you only have to do it occasionally and you don't have those fancy tools.
          p This tool you allows to quickly format your sequence to fit your needed layout.

            | competition in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which two friends and I entered in high school back in 1999.
            | This is the work we did on identifying different leaf pigments over the course of a year in #[i Parthenocissus tricuspidata], titled
            | #[em(lang="de-DE") &quot;Die Wilden Farben des Wilden Weins&quot;] - #[em &quot;The Various Colors of Boston Ivy&quot;].
