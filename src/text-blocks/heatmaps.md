Calendar heatmaps are a great tool to visualize clusters, outliers, trends, and seasonal cycles over different time periods, using a calendar layout with color gradients.

The plugin I built for the JavaScript library jQuery allows to generate an HTML heatmap calendar that can be integrated into a website and dynamically be updated.

Since the jQuery plugin doesn't produce a vector-based graphic (SVG), I also created a small tool, that generates such graphics from data files with rich modification options and that doesn't require programming knowledge.
