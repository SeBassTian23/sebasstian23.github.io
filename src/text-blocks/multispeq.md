During my time in Dr. David Kramer's lab at Michigan State University, I contributed to the development of an innovative research platform to enable collaborative spectrophotometric data collection and analysis of photosynthetic data. My role involved creating online data visualizations, a desktop application, documentation, and testing hardware - all done in coordination with an interdisciplinary team.

This allowed me to apply and improve my skills in software development, data science, and photosynthesis research to advance a novel platform aimed at sharing photosynthetic measurements in new ways. These tools can now be used in my research on the regulation of photosynthesis _in situ_ at a larger scale and under various, real-world environmental conditions.
