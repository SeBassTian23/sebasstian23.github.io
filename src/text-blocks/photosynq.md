Working at Michigan State University in David Kramer's lab presented the opportunity to become part of this project, developing a research platform that allows the collection of photosynthetic data in a collaborative way using a handheld spectrophotometer.

This work included developing online data visualization, a desktop application, functions for data analysis, documentation, and hardware testing, all in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team.
