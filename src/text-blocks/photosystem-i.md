The photosynthetic machinery in higher plants, as well as in many groups of the green clade, consists of two photosystems, I and II. While photosystem II is the first step in the electron transport chain to split water, photosystem I catalyzes the final step, transferring electrons from plastocyanin to ferredoxin.

My graduate work in Dr. Michael Hippler's lab focused on the interaction between photosystem I and plastocyanin in _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ and how small modifications to specific amino acids at the photosystem's donor side can alter the binding kinetics and drastically impact the rate of photosynthesis as a whole.
