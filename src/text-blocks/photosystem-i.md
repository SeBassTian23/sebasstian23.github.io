The photosynthetic machinery in higher plants, as well as in many groups of the green clade, consists of two Photosystems, I and II. While Photosystem II is the first in the electron transport chain to split water, Photosystem I catalyzes the final step, transferring electrons from Plastocyanin to Ferredoxin.

During graduate school, I worked in Michael Hippler's lab on the interaction between Photosystem I and Plastocyanin in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and how small modifications to specific amino acids at its donor side can alter the reaction kinetics and drastically change the rate of Photosynthesis as a whole.
