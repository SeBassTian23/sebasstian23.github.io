In nature, plants face the challenge of rapidly changing light intensities amongst many other abiotic conditions, transitioning from full sunlight to shade, often within seconds or even shorter time scales. The cause can be scattered clouds, wind-moving leaves, or light scattering throughout the canopy.

I'm interested in how photosynthesis is regulated under these conditions, so harmful by-products can be avoided, and the photosynthetic machinery is sufficiently protected, yet over-protection and resulting inefficiency are avoided.
