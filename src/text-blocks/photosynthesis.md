In nature, plants face the challenge of rapidly changing light conditions, transitioning from full sunlight to dim light, often within seconds or even shorter time scales. The cause can be manyfold, but the majority is due to clouds, wind moving leaves, or light scatters throughout the canopy. I'm interested in how Photosynthesis is regulated under these conditions, so harmful by-products can be avoided and the photosynthetic machinery is protected yet it not becomes inefficient.

Currently, I'm using the PhotosynQ platform to explore photosynthetic responses and regulation on a large, global scale.
