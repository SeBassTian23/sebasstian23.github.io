Living and traveling in Michigan provides ample opportunities to take pictures of the beautiful landscape. Especially fall and winter present a plethora of possibilities when traveling Up North if you don't mind a crisp cold day.

Joining the [Mid Michigan Photography Club](https://mmphotoclub.net/) was not only a great opportunity to meet people who are passionate about photography but to get out, shoot and discover new places in the greater Lansing area.
