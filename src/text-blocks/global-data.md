Since the initial prototype of the MultispeQ in 2014, users have collected hundreds of thousands of measurements all over the world to examine plant photosynthesis.

And this is not just happening inside labs, but mostly in greenhouses and outside in the field.

This open collection of data is providing much deeper insights into how plant photosynthesis performs in the field and how it compares to the lab.
