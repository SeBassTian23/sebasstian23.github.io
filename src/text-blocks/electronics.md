Through my work, I got introduced to the world of electronics, which doesn't mean I can now design my own PCBs, but thanks to the availability of breakout boards and beginner-friendly hardware, I finished some projects that are now used in my everyday life including a display for weather forcast, a calendar and a weather station.

Especially the eInk technology is fascinating since, in combination with an ESP32 to access online sources, it allows to run projects displaying current data for months at a time on a single charge.
